UPER Problem Solving Framework

U - Understand the problem.
P - Plan how to solve the problem.
E - Execute your plan.
R - Reflect on your work, your results, and the process. 

Understand:
Be honest with yourself with what you understand or don’t understand.

How much do I understand each topic?
I have worked with functional components to build projects in the past.

React.Component allows you to tap into methods that come from the Component Lifecycle.

How can I be more specific with what I don’t know?


What would your final results look like?

A styled todo list app that allows you to add new todos and clear completed todos.

What does the project do/functionality?

[ ] Your todo list should display a list of todos, an input field, a submit button, and a clear all button.
[ ] Be sure to use the given files for building out these components.
[ ]`<App />` will hold all the data needed for this project. It will also be the container for your Todo Components.
  [ ] All of your application data will be stored here on `<App />`.
  [ ] All of your `handler` functions should live here on `<App />`.
[ ] `<TodoList />` receives your Todos array and iterates over the list generating a new `<Todo />` for each element in the array.
[ ]`<Todo />` is a component that takes in the `todo` data and displays the task to the screen.
[ ]`<TodoForm>` will hold your input field and your `Add Todo` and `Clear Completed` buttons.
  [ ] Your input field should take in user input, and allow a user to press `Enter` or click on the `Submit Button` to add a todo to your list.
  [ ] Once a todo is submitted, the Todo List should re-render and show the added todo.
  [ ] Add the functionality to toggle your todo's completed flag from `false` to `true`.
  [ ] Once a todo is completed, be sure to demonstrate to the user that the todo is completed by adding a line-through style property if the completed flag is true.
[ ] Add the ability to remove any todos that you have completed. `.filter` will be your best friend here. When a user clicks on the `Clear Completed` button call your handler function that will filter out any todos that have the completed flag toggled to `true`.
[ ] **Now is the time to style** Take your time to make this an app that you can be proud of.
